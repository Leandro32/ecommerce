üì± **TASK 4: WHATSAPP CHECKOUT WITH LOCAL STORAGE PERSISTENCE**
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*Implement a checkout flow that saves the order in the user's browser via `localStorage` before redirecting to WhatsApp. This approach provides persistence for the user's cart at the point of checkout without requiring a backend, making it a robust client-side MVP.*

### 1. Local Order Persistence
- [x] Choose `localStorage` as the storage mechanism for its persistence across sessions.
- [x] Define a clear data structure for the saved order. It should include:
    - `id`: A unique client-side ID (e.g., using `Date.now()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`).
    - `items`: A copy of the cart items.
    - `total`: The final price.
    - `timestamp`: When the order was created.
    - `status`: A default status, e.g., `"pending_whatsapp_confirmation"`.
- [x] Create a utility module (e.g., `src/utils/localOrderManager.ts`) with functions to manage local orders (`saveOrder`, `getOrders`, etc.).

### 2. Updated Checkout Flow & User Experience
- [x] When the user clicks "Checkout with WhatsApp":
    1.  The system will first save the current cart as an "order" object in `localStorage`.
    2.  The UI must update to give feedback to the user, for example: *"¬°Perfecto! Hemos guardado tu pedido en este navegador. Ahora, env√≠anos el mensaje por WhatsApp para confirmarlo."*
    3.  Only after the save is successful, present the button/link to open WhatsApp.
- [x] This flow ensures that if the user accidentally closes the tab or doesn't send the message, their intended order is not lost and can be retrieved from their browser.

### 3. WhatsApp Message Generation
- [x] Create a function that generates the `wa.me` link.
- [x] The message content must be properly URL-encoded using `encodeURIComponent` to handle special characters and line breaks.
- [x] The seller's WhatsApp number must be stored as an environment variable (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`) to avoid hardcoding it.
- [x] The message template will not include an order number, as per the requirements.

#### Message Template
```
Hola, buen dia!
Quiero comprar estos productos:

${cartItems.map(item => `‚Ä¢ ${item.name} x${item.quantity} - ${item.price}`)}

üí∞ *Total: ${cartTotal}*

Muchas gracias!
```

### 4. Client-Side Order History (Highly Recommended)
- [x] Create a simple component or view where the user can see a list of the orders they've placed, pulling the data directly from `localStorage`.
- [x] This gives the user confidence and a way to track their actions, showing a list of "pending" orders.
- [x] Each item in the history could even have a "Reintentar env√≠o por WhatsApp" button in case the first attempt failed.

### 5. Technical Considerations & Limitations to Acknowledge
- **No Stock Reservation**: This flow does not communicate with a backend, so stock cannot be reserved. Multiple users could try to buy the last item in stock.
- **Data is Local**: The order is only stored on the user's device. If they clear their browser data or switch devices, the history is lost. This must be acceptable for the MVP.
- **Manual Confirmation**: The seller's process remains 100% manual. The order is only "known" to the business once the WhatsApp message is received.

**FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ `src/types/order.ts` - New type definition for orders.
- ‚úÖ `src/utils/localOrderManager.ts` - New utility for local storage management.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/checkout.tsx` - Updated to implement WhatsApp checkout flow.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/account.tsx` - Updated to display client-side order history.

üõí **TASK 5: ENHANCE CART VIEW WITH ORDER HISTORY**
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*As a senior software developer, I've enhanced the user experience by utilizing the empty state of the cart page to display the user's order history. This provides value to returning customers and makes the page more dynamic.*

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
- [x] Created a new reusable component `OrderHistory.tsx` to display the list of orders. This promotes separation of concerns and reusability.

### 2. Smart UI in Cart Page
- [x] Modified `cart.tsx` to conditionally render the `OrderHistory` component when the cart is empty but there are past orders in `localStorage`.
- [x] If the cart is empty and there is no order history, the original "empty cart" message is displayed.

### 3. User-Centric Design
- [x] The "Resend on WhatsApp" button is available for each order, allowing users to easily retry sending their order.
- [x] The order history is displayed in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent orders first.

**FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ `src/components/OrderHistory.tsx` - New component to display order history.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/cart.tsx` - Updated to conditionally render the order history.

## üöÄ **TASK 6: MIGRATE APPLICATION FROM VITE TO NEXT.JS**
**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*A comprehensive plan to migrate the existing React + Vite SPA to Next.js. This architectural upgrade will enhance performance, SEO, and security by leveraging Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the App Router, and server-side data fetching.*

### **Strategy**
- The migration will be performed iteratively, on a route-by-route basis, to ensure stability and make debugging manageable.
- The process will begin with the base layout and home page, then progressively expand to other routes.

### **Phase 1: Project Scaffolding & Dependency Migration**
- [x] Initialize a new Next.js project: `npx create-next-app@latest --typescript --tailwind ecommerce-nextjs`
- [x] Analyze the current `package.json` and install all necessary dependencies into the new project.
- [x] Install required development dependencies.
- [x] Migrate configurations from `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`.
- [x] Ensure global styles from `src/index.css` are correctly imported into the new `app/layout.tsx`.

### **Phase 2: Asset & Component Migration**
- [x] Copy the contents of `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/locales`, `src/types`, `src/utils`, and `public/` directories into the new project structure.
- [x] Audit all copied components and add the `'use client';` directive to any component that uses React Hooks or browser-only APIs.
- [x] Create a new `.env.local` file and migrate environment variables, renaming the prefix from `VITE_` to `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for browser-exposed variables.

### **Phase 3: Routing, Layout, and i18n Refactor**
- [x] Recreate the application's page structure inside the Next.js `app/` directory (e.g., `app/products/page.tsx`).
- [x] Create a root layout in `app/layout.tsx` and integrate shared components like `Header` and `Footer`.
- [x] Replace all instances of `react-router-dom`'s `<Link>` component with `next/link`.
- [x] Implement a server-aware i18n strategy by replacing `i18next-browser-languagedetector` with a library compatible with the Next.js App Router (e.g., `next-intl`). Use middleware to detect language from the URL and load translations on the server.
- [x] Replace programmatic navigation hooks (`useHistory`) with the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation`.

### **Phase 4: Server-Side Data Fetching & State Management**
- [x] Create a `lib/` directory and move the data fetching logic (`googleSheetsService.ts`) into it.
- [x] Refactor pages to be async Server Components that fetch data directly on the server.
- [x] Define the new filtering strategy: User interactions in client-side filter components will update URL query parameters (e.g., `?category=electronics`), which will trigger a server-side refetch and re-render of the product list.
- [x] Replace the custom 5-minute cache in `googleSheetsService.ts` with Next.js's integrated data cache, using its time-based revalidation feature.
- [x] Manage client-side state (e.g., `CartContext`, `AuthContext`) by creating a root "Providers" component marked with `'use client';`. This component will wrap the application in `app/layout.tsx` to make contexts available across the app.
- [x] Secure the Google Sheets API key by removing the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix from its variable in `.env.local`, making it a server-only secret.
- [x] Update the data fetching logic to read the API key from `process.env`.

### **Phase 5: Cleanup and Finalization**
- [x] Uninstall all Vite and React Router dependencies: `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `react-router-dom`.
- [x] Delete obsolete configuration files like `vite.config.ts`.
- [x] Update the `scripts` in `package.json` to use Next.js commands (`next dev`, `next build`, `next start`, `next lint`).
- [x] Conduct a full regression test of the application.
- [x] Verify that API keys are no longer exposed in the browser and that initial page content is server-rendered.
- [x] Update the `README.md` to reflect the new technology stack and commands.

## üîê TASK 7: CREATE SECURE ADMIN PANEL FOR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚ùå NOT STARTED**
*Develop a secure, lightweight admin panel. The architecture will consist of a standalone Node.js/Express API deployed as serverless functions for maximum resource efficiency, and a new set of protected frontend routes in the existing React application.*

### 1. Backend: Lightweight Node.js API
- [ ] Create a new `/api` directory for the backend code.
- [ ] Initialize a Node.js project with Express.js.
- [ ] **Choose Database**: A serverless PostgreSQL provider (e.g., Vercel Postgres, Neon) is recommended for its low cost and scalability.
- [ ] **Implement Authentication**: Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Create endpoints for login (`/api/auth/login`) that returns a token, and a middleware to protect all admin routes.
- [ ] **Implement Product API Endpoints**:
    - `GET /api/products`
    - `POST /api/products`
    - `PUT /api/products/:id`
    - `DELETE /api/products/:id`
- [ ] **Data Validation**: Use a library like `Zod` to validate all incoming requests.
- [ ] **Deployment**: Configure the Express app to be deployed as serverless functions on Vercel/Netlify.

### 2. Frontend: React Admin Interface
- [ ] Create a new set of "admin" routes in your React app using your current router (e.g., React Router).
    - `/admin/login`
    - `/admin/dashboard` (this will be a protected route)
- [ ] **Create a `useAuth` Hook**: This hook will manage the JWT token in `localStorage`, handle login/logout, and provide authentication status to components.
- [ ] **Create Protected Routes**: Implement a wrapper component that checks for a valid token using the `useAuth` hook. If the user is not logged in, redirect them to `/admin/login`.
- [ ] **Build UI Components**:
    - A login form.
    - A data table to display and manage products.
    - A form (using `react-hook-form`) for creating/editing products.
    - These components will fetch data from and send data to the Node.js API.
