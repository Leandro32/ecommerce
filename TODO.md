üì± **TASK 4: WHATSAPP CHECKOUT WITH LOCAL STORAGE PERSISTENCE**
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*Implement a checkout flow that saves the order in the user's browser via `localStorage` before redirecting to WhatsApp. This approach provides persistence for the user's cart at the point of checkout without requiring a backend, making it a robust client-side MVP.*

### 1. Local Order Persistence
- [x] Choose `localStorage` as the storage mechanism for its persistence across sessions.
- [x] Define a clear data structure for the saved order. It should include:
    - `id`: A unique client-side ID (e.g., using `Date.now()` or `crypto.randomUUID()`).
    - `items`: A copy of the cart items.
    - `total`: The final price.
    - `timestamp`: When the order was created.
    - `status`: A default status, e.g., `"pending_whatsapp_confirmation"`.
- [x] Create a utility module (e.g., `src/utils/localOrderManager.ts`) with functions to manage local orders (`saveOrder`, `getOrders`, etc.).

### 2. Updated Checkout Flow & User Experience
- [x] When the user clicks "Checkout with WhatsApp":
    1.  The system will first save the current cart as an "order" object in `localStorage`.
    2.  The UI must update to give feedback to the user, for example: *"¬°Perfecto! Hemos guardado tu pedido en este navegador. Ahora, env√≠anos el mensaje por WhatsApp para confirmarlo."*
    3.  Only after the save is successful, present the button/link to open WhatsApp.
- [x] This flow ensures that if the user accidentally closes the tab or doesn't send the message, their intended order is not lost and can be retrieved from their browser.

### 3. WhatsApp Message Generation
- [x] Create a function that generates the `wa.me` link.
- [x] The message content must be properly URL-encoded using `encodeURIComponent` to handle special characters and line breaks.
- [x] The seller's WhatsApp number must be stored as an environment variable (`NEXT_PUBLIC_WHATSAPP_NUMBER`) to avoid hardcoding it.
- [x] The message template will not include an order number, as per the requirements.

#### Message Template
```
Hola, buen dia!
Quiero comprar estos productos:

${cartItems.map(item => `‚Ä¢ ${item.name} x${item.quantity} - ${item.price}`)}

üí∞ *Total: ${cartTotal}*

Muchas gracias!
```

### 4. Client-Side Order History (Highly Recommended)
- [x] Create a simple component or view where the user can see a list of the orders they've placed, pulling the data directly from `localStorage`.
- [x] This gives the user confidence and a way to track their actions, showing a list of "pending" orders.
- [x] Each item in the history could even have a "Reintentar env√≠o por WhatsApp" button in case the first attempt failed.

### 5. Technical Considerations & Limitations to Acknowledge
- **No Stock Reservation**: This flow does not communicate with a backend, so stock cannot be reserved. Multiple users could try to buy the last item in stock.
- **Data is Local**: The order is only stored on the user's device. If they clear their browser data or switch devices, the history is lost. This must be acceptable for the MVP.
- **Manual Confirmation**: The seller's process remains 100% manual. The order is only "known" to the business once the WhatsApp message is received.

**FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ `src/types/order.ts` - New type definition for orders.
- ‚úÖ `src/utils/localOrderManager.ts` - New utility for local storage management.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/checkout.tsx` - Updated to implement WhatsApp checkout flow.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/account.tsx` - Updated to display client-side order history.
---

üõí **TASK 5: ENHANCE CART VIEW WITH ORDER HISTORY**
**Priority: MEDIUM** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*As a senior software developer, I've enhanced the user experience by utilizing the empty state of the cart page to display the user's order history. This provides value to returning customers and makes the page more dynamic.*

### 1. Component-Based Architecture
- [x] Created a new reusable component `OrderHistory.tsx` to display the list of orders. This promotes separation of concerns and reusability.

### 2. Smart UI in Cart Page
- [x] Modified `cart.tsx` to conditionally render the `OrderHistory` component when the cart is empty but there are past orders in `localStorage`.
- [x] If the cart is empty and there is no order history, the original "empty cart" message is displayed.

### 3. User-Centric Design
- [x] The "Resend on WhatsApp" button is available for each order, allowing users to easily retry sending their order.
- [x] The order history is displayed in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent orders first.

**FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:**
- ‚úÖ `src/components/OrderHistory.tsx` - New component to display order history.
- ‚úÖ `src/pages/cart.tsx` - Updated to conditionally render the order history.

## üöÄ **TASK 6: MIGRATE APPLICATION FROM VITE TO NEXT.JS**
**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*A comprehensive plan to migrate the existing React + Vite SPA to Next.js. This architectural upgrade will enhance performance, SEO, and security by leveraging Server-Side Rendering (SSR), the App Router, and server-side data fetching.*

### **Strategy**
- The migration was performed iteratively, on a route-by-route basis, to ensure stability and make debugging manageable.
- The process began with the base layout and home page, then progressively expanded to other routes.

*(Details of migration phases omitted for brevity as they are complete)*

---

## üîê **TASK 7: INTEGRATE ADMIN PANEL UI**
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**
*Integrate the standalone React/Vite admin panel prototype into the main Next.js application. This provides a functional UI for demonstration and future backend integration, accessible under the `/admin` path.*

### 1. Architectural Refactoring
- [x] **Isolate Layouts**: Created `(admin)` and `(store)` route groups to support multiple, independent root layouts.
- [x] **Implement Multiple Roots**: Removed the single global layout and created separate root layouts for each group (`app/(store)/layout.tsx` and `app/(admin)/layout.tsx`) to prevent UI conflicts and fix hydration errors.

### 2. Admin App Integration & Bug Fixing
- [x] **Host SPA**: Created a catch-all route at `app/(admin)/admin/[[...slug]]/page.tsx` to host the admin panel as a Single Page Application.
- [x] **Fix SSR Errors**: Used `next/dynamic` with `ssr: false` to ensure the admin app only renders on the client, resolving `document is not defined` errors.
- [x] **Fix Navigation**: Switched from `BrowserRouter` to `HashRouter` to prevent full-page reloads during internal admin navigation.
- [x] **Fix Module Not Found Errors**: Corrected all broken relative import paths in the store pages after refactoring the directory structure.
- [x] **Configure Images**: Updated `next.config.mjs` to authorize external image hostnames used in product data.
- [x] **Fix CSS Build**: Replaced Vite-specific CSS directives with standard Tailwind syntax in the admin's stylesheet.

### 3. Configuration & Dependencies
- [x] **Dependencies**: Merged all required dependencies from the admin project into the main `package.json`.
- [x] **Styling**: Updated the root `tailwind.config.js` with the admin panel's specific theme and content paths.

---

## üîê TASK 8: CREATE SECURE ADMIN PANEL FOR INVENTORY MANAGEMENT
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚ùå NOT STARTED**
*Develop a secure, full-featured admin panel integrated into the Next.js application. This panel will manage products and the entire order lifecycle, from manual creation to final fulfillment. It will leverage Next.js API Routes for the backend and `NextAuth.js` for robust security.*

### 1. Backend: Next.js API Routes & Authentication
- [x] **Authentication**: Implement `NextAuth.js` with a Credentials Provider.
    - [x] Store admin credentials in the database (e.g., an `Admin` model).
    - [x] Create a seeding script to create the initial admin user with a hashed password.
    - [x] Use `bcrypt` to compare the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
    - [x] Configure session management to use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless authentication.
- [x] **API Structure**: Create all backend logic within the `app/api/v1/admin/` directory to version the API from the start.
- [x] **Secure Endpoints**: Protect all admin API routes.
    - [x] Implement middleware in `app/api/v1/admin/` to centralize session validation, ensuring only authenticated admins can access endpoints.
    - [x] Define robust error handling, using `try-catch` blocks and returning consistent JSON error responses (e.g., `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }` with a `401` status code).
- [x] **Database**: Utilize a serverless PostgreSQL provider (e.g., Vercel Postgres, Neon).
    - [x] Integrate `Prisma` as the ORM for type-safe database access.
    - [x] Define the database schema for `Admin`, `Product`, and `Order` models.
- [x] **Implement Product CRUD Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /api/v1/admin/products`: Fetch all products.
    - [x] `POST /api/v1/admin/products`: Create a new product.
    - [x] `PUT /api/v1/admin/products/[id]`: Update an existing product.
    - [x] `DELETE /api/v1/admin/products/[id]`: Delete a product.
    - [ ] **Image Handling**: Implement image uploads to a cloud storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Cloudinary). The `Product` model should store the image URL.
- [x] **Implement Order Management Endpoints**:
    - [x] `GET /api/v1/admin/orders`: Fetch all orders.
    - [x] `POST /api/v1/admin/orders`: Create a new order (manual creation).
    - [x] `PUT /api/v1/admin/orders/[id]`: Update the status of an order.
- [x] **Data Validation**: Use a library like `Zod` to validate the body of all `POST` and `PUT` requests to ensure data integrity.

### 2. Frontend: Admin UI (A Guide for Junior Developers)
*This section breaks down the frontend work into smaller, more manageable tasks, explaining the "why" behind each step in a Next.js App Router environment.*

#### **Sub-Task 2.1: Core Layout & Routing**
*Goal: Create a protected area for the admin panel with consistent navigation.*
- [x] **Create Route Group**: In the `app/` directory, create a new folder named `(admin)`. This is a "route group" ‚Äì it lets us create a special layout for admin pages without changing the URL (e.g., the page will be `/dashboard`, not `/(admin)/dashboard`).
- [x] **Implement Root Layout (`app/(admin)/layout.tsx`)**: This is a **Server Component**. Its job is to protect all child pages.
    - [ ] Inside this component, get the user's session from `NextAuth.js` on the server.
    - [ ] If there is no session, immediately redirect the user to the `/login` page using `redirect` from `next/navigation`.
    - [ ] If there is a session, render the child pages. This layout should include a `<Sidebar />` component and a main content area.
- [x] **Create Sidebar Component**: This will be a **Client Component** (`'use client'`) because it will manage interactive states (like which link is active).
    - [ ] Use the `<Link>` component from `next/link` for navigation to Dashboard, Products, and Orders.
    - [ ] Add a "Logout" button that calls the `signOut()` function from `next-auth/react`.

#### **Sub-Task 2.2: Login Page**
*Goal: Build a form to allow the admin to sign in.*
- [x] **Create Login Page (`app/(admin)/login/page.tsx`)**: This must be a **Client Component** (`'use client'`) because it handles user input.
    - [x] Use `useState` hooks to manage the `username` and `password` fields.
    - [x] On form submission, call the `signIn('credentials', ...)` function from `NextAuth.js`.
    - [x] Provide user feedback for loading states (e.g., disable the button) and display any login errors.

#### **Sub-Task 2.3: Dashboard Page**
*Goal: Show a high-level overview of the store's activity.*
- [x] **Create Dashboard Page (`app/(admin)/dashboard/page.tsx`)**: This is a **Server Component**. It will fetch data directly.
    - [ ] Inside the component (`async function DashboardPage()`), fetch the data needed for the KPI cards (e.g., total revenue, new order count) from your API.
    - [ ] Create a small, reusable `<KpiCard />` component to display each metric.
    - [ ] Create a `<RecentOrdersList />` component (can also be a Server Component) that fetches and displays the last 5-10 orders.

#### **Sub-Task 2.4: Products - List View**
*Goal: Display all products in a table with search and filter functionality.*
- [ ] **Create Product List Page (`app/(admin)/products/page.tsx`)**: This is a **Server Component**.
    - [ ] It will read the URL's search parameters (e.g., `?q=...` or `?category=...`) to fetch the correctly filtered list of products from the API.
- [ ] **Create Product Table Component (`<ProductTable />`)**: This is a **Client Component** (`'use client'`) that receives the product data as a prop from the page.
    - [ ] It is responsible for rendering the `<table>` structure.
    - [ ] It will manage UI state, such as which "delete confirmation" dialog is open, using `useState`.
- [ ] **Create Filter Components (`<SearchInput />`, `<CategoryFilter />`)**: These are **Client Components**.
    - [ ] When the user types in the search bar or selects a category, use the `useRouter` hook from `next/navigation` to update the URL's query parameters. This will automatically trigger Next.js to re-run the Server Component page with the new parameters, re-fetching the data.

#### **Sub-Task 2.5: Products - Create/Edit Form**
*Goal: Build a form to create and update product details.*
- [ ] **Create Product Form Page (`app/(admin)/products/new/page.tsx`, `.../[id]/edit/page.tsx`)**: This must be a **Client Component** (`'use client'`) because forms are highly interactive.
    - [ ] Use `react-hook-form` to manage form state, validation, and submission.
    - [ ] For the `description` field, integrate a rich text editor library like `react-quill`.
    - [ ] For image uploads, use a library like `react-dropzone`. When a file is added, upload it to your backend via a dedicated API route, and store the returned URL in your form's state.
    - [ ] The final `onSubmit` handler will call your API to either `POST` (create) or `PUT` (update) the product.

#### **Sub-Task 2.6: Orders - List View & Detail View**
*Goal: Display and manage all orders and their lifecycle.*
- [ ] **Create Order List Page (`app/(admin)/orders/page.tsx`)**: Follow the same pattern as the Product List page (Server Component for data fetching, Client Component for the interactive table).
    - [ ] **Create Status Badge Component (`<StatusBadge />`)**: This component will take a status string as a prop and render a colored badge. This is crucial for at-a-glance understanding. The required statuses and their colors are:
        - `Solicitud / Nuevo`: **Blue**
        - `Enviado / En Proceso`: **Orange**
        - `Aceptado`: **Light Green**
        - `Cancelado`: **Red**
        - `Enviado / Cumplido`: **Purple**
        - `Recibido / Conforme`: **Teal**
        - `Facturado / Pagado`: **Dark Green**
        - `Cerrado`: **Gray**
- [ ] **Create Order Detail Page (`app/(admin)/orders/[id]/page.tsx`)**: This page will fetch all data for a single order on the server.
    - [ ] **Create Status Updater Component (`<StatusUpdater />`)**: This is a **Client Component** that gets the `orderId` and current `status` as props.
        - [ ] It will contain a `<select>` dropdown pre-populated with all possible order statuses listed above.
        - [ ] When the user selects a new status and clicks a "Save" button, it calls the `PUT /api/admin/orders/[id]` endpoint with the new status.
    - [ ] **Create Internal Notes Component (`<InternalNotes />`)**: This is a **Client Component**. It will have a `<textarea>` and a "Add Note" button to post new notes. It will also fetch and display the list of existing notes for that order.

#### **Sub-Task 2.7: Orders - Create Form**
*Goal: Build the form for the admin to manually create a new order.*
- [ ] **Create Order Form Page (`app/(admin)/orders/new/page.tsx`)**: This is a complex **Client Component**.
    - [ ] **Create Line Item Builder (`<LineItemBuilder />`)**:
        - [ ] Use a debounced search input (`<ProductSearchInput />`) to find products.
        - [ ] Manage the list of selected products in an array in state. Ensure the UI can handle adding and removing items from this list.
        - [ ] Automatically calculate totals whenever the list of items or their quantities change.
    - [ ] The final "Save Order" button should be disabled during the API call.
    - [ ] On success, show a success toast and redirect the user to the newly created order's detail page.

## ü¶∏ **TASK 13: CREATE ADMINISTRATOR VIEW FOR HERO**

2This task involves creating a new page in the `/admin` section to manage the content of the hero section on the homepage. This includes the ability to edit the hero image, title, paragraph, and buttons.

#### **Part 1: Backend Setup (Strapi)**

The first step is to create a new "Collection Type" in Strapi to hold the hero section's content.

1.  **Log in to your Strapi Admin Panel.**
2.  Navigate to **Content-Type Builder**.
3.  Click on **Create new collection type**.
4.  Set the `Display name` to `Hero` and click **Continue**.
5.  Add the following fields to your `Hero` collection type:
    *   **`title`**: `Text` field (Short text).
    *   **`paragraph`**: `Text` field (Long text).
    *   **`heroImage`**: `Media` field (Single media).
    *   **`buttonLayout`**: `Enumeration` field with the following values: `none`, `oneButton`, `twoButtons`.
    *   **`buttons`**: A `Component` field. You'll need to create a new component named `Button` with the following fields:
        *   `buttonText`: `Text` field (Short text).
        *   `buttonLink`: `Text` field (Short text).
        *   `isExternal`: `Boolean` field.
        *   `variant`: `Enumeration` field with values like `primary`, `secondary`.

#### **Part 2: Frontend Implementation (Next.js)**

Now, let's create the administrator view in the Next.js application.

1.  **Create the API Service:**
    *   Create a new file at `ecommerce/lib/api.ts`. This file will contain the functions to interact with the Strapi API.
    *   You'll need to use an HTTP client like `axios` or the built-in `fetch` API to make requests to your Strapi backend.
    *   Implement the following functions in `ecommerce/lib/api.ts`:
        *   `getHero()`: Fetches the hero content from Strapi.
        *   `updateHero(data)`: Updates the hero content in Strapi.

2.  **Create the Admin Page:**
    *   Create a new file at `ecommerce/app/admin/hero/page.tsx`.
    *   This page will contain a form with the following fields:
        *   An input for the `title`.
        *   A textarea for the `paragraph`.
        *   A file upload component for the `heroImage`.
        *   A dropdown to select the `buttonLayout`.
        *   A section to manage the buttons. This section will show/hide input fields for the buttons based on the selected `buttonLayout`.
    *   Use React's `useState` hook to manage the form's state.
    *   Fetch the initial hero content using the `getHero` function from your API service and populate the form.
    *   When the form is submitted, call the `updateHero` function from your API service to save the changes.

3.  **Update the Homepage:**
    *   Open the homepage file at `ecommerce/app/page.tsx`.
    *   Use the `getHero` function from your API service to fetch the hero content.
    *   Render the hero section dynamically based on the fetched data. This includes displaying the title, paragraph, image, and the correct number of buttons with the correct text and links.


## üì∏ **TASK 10: IMPLEMENT SERVER-SIDE IMAGE UPLOAD AND SERVING**
**Priority: HIGH** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

*This task involves implementing a robust system for uploading product images directly to the Next.js server's `public` directory and serving them from there. This approach avoids external cloud storage dependencies and simplifies `next.config.js` configuration.*

### 1. Backend - Image Upload API
- [x] **Install Dependencies:** Install `formidable` for handling multipart form data and `uuid` for generating unique filenames.
- [x] **Create `POST /api/v1/admin/upload-image` API Route (`app/api/v1/admin/upload-image/route.ts`):**
    - [x] Configure the API route to handle `multipart/form-data` requests.
    - [x] Use `formidable` to parse the incoming file upload.
    - [x] Generate a unique filename for each uploaded image (e.g., using `uuid` and preserving the original file extension).
    - [x] Save the uploaded image file to a designated directory within the `public` folder (e.g., `public/uploads/products`). Create this directory if it doesn't exist.
    - [x] Return the relative URL of the saved image (e.g., `/uploads/products/unique-filename.jpg`) in the API response.
    - [x] Implement error handling for file size limits, invalid file types, and disk write errors.

### 2. Frontend - Integrate Image Upload in Admin Product Form
- [x] **Product Form Page (`src/admin/pages/product-form-page.tsx`):**
    - [x] **Add File Input:** Integrated a file input element into the product creation/edit form.
    - [x] **Handle File Selection:** Implemented a function to handle file selection and upload.
    - [x] **Upload Logic:** Called the `POST /api/v1/admin/upload-image` API route.
    - [x] **Update `imageUrl`:** Updated the `imageUrl` field in the product form's state with the returned URL.
    - [x] **Display Preview:** Displayed a preview of the selected/uploaded image.

### 3. Frontend - Update `next.config.mjs`
- [x] **Remove External Domains:** Removed all external image domains from `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.mjs`.
- [x] **Configure Local Images:** Ensured `next/image` is configured to allow images from your own domain (which is the default for images in `/public`, so no explicit `remotePatterns` entry is needed for your own domain).

### 4. Data Migration (Consideration)
- [ ] **Existing External Images:** For any existing product data that still points to external domains, consider a one-time script to download these images, upload them to your server via the new API, and update their `imageUrl` in the database. This is outside the scope of this task but is a necessary follow-up for a complete solution.

## üîó **TASK 9: CONNECT FRONTEND COMPONENTS TO BACKEND API**
**Priority: CRITICAL** | **Status: ‚úÖ COMPLETED**

*This task involves creating public API endpoints for the storefront and connecting all frontend components (both the public ecommerce site and the admin panel) to the newly created backend APIs.*

### 1. Create Public API Endpoints (Backend)

- [x] **API Structure:** Create all public-facing backend logic within the `app/api/v1/` directory for versioning consistency.
- [x] **Product Endpoints:**
    - [x] `GET /api/v1/products`: Create an endpoint to fetch all products.
    - [x] `GET /api/v1/products/[id]`: Create an endpoint to fetch a single product by ID.
- [x] **Order Endpoint:**
    - [x] `POST /api/v1/orders`: Create a public endpoint for customers to submit new orders.
        - [x] **Crucial:** This endpoint must perform **stock validation** before creating an order. If an item is out of stock, it should return a `400 Bad Request` error.
        - [x] On successful order creation, it must **decrement the stock** for the purchased products.

### 2. Connect Ecommerce Frontend to API

- [x] **Data Fetching Strategy:**
    - [x] Introduce and configure a data-fetching library like **SWR** or **TanStack Query (React Query)** to manage server state, caching, and revalidation.
- [x] **Product Pages:**
    - [x] Refactor the product list and detail pages to fetch data from the new `/api/v1/products` endpoints instead of using mock data.
    - [x] Implement proper loading and error states.
- [x] **Checkout Process:**
    - [x] **Replace WhatsApp Flow:** The checkout page will be modified to submit orders directly to the `POST /api/v1/orders` endpoint. The `localStorage` and WhatsApp logic will be removed.
    - [x] Provide clear success or error feedback to the user based on the API response (e.g., "Order placed successfully!" or "Some items are out of stock.").

### 3. Connect Admin Panel Frontend to API

- [x] **Follow the detailed plan in TASK 8 (Section 2: Frontend: Admin UI)**, which already provides a comprehensive guide for connecting all admin components to the existing `/api/v1/admin/*` endpoints. This includes:
    - [x] Dashboard Page
    - [x] Product Management (List, Create, Edit)
    - [x] Order Management (List, Details, Status Update)
