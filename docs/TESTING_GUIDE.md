# Google Sheets Integration - Testing Guide

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

Your ecommerce app is now ready to test with both mock data and Google Sheets integration!

### Immediate Testing (Mock Data)

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

2. **View the app**: Open http://localhost:8000

3. **Check the status**: Look for the data source indicator in the bottom-right corner

The app will automatically use mock data for testing since `VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true` is set in your `.env` file.

## üîÑ Switching Between Mock Data and Google Sheets

### Option 1: Use Mock Data (Default - Recommended for Testing)
```env
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

### Option 2: Use Google Sheets (After Setup)
```env
VITE_USE_MOCK_DATA=false
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
VITE_GOOGLE_SHEETS_ID=your_actual_sheet_id
```
